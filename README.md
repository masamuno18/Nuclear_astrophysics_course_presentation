# Nuclear_astrophysics_course_presentation
Contains the presentations that I presented as part of my course work in Nuclear Astrophysics. The topic I selected was Dark Stars where I discussed about the general discription of matter and dark matter with its implication in the formation and powering of early stars and their birth in the dark matter halo and their journey. I then concluded with the implication in the formation of the primodial stars population III stars powered by Dark Matter components.
