# Dark-Matter_presentation_Nuclear_Astrophysics
The repository contains the presentations that I presented as part of my course work in Nuclear Astrophysics PHN-331 during Fall 2020. The topic I worked on was Dark Matter and Dark Stars where I discussed about the general discription of matter and dark matter, their possible implication in the formation and powering of early stars (Population III stars) and possible evolutionary step for super-massive black holes, their birth in the dark matter halos and their journey. 

I made a powerpoint presentation available in the repository and a 15 min short video presentation explaining my project work (avaiable at [video] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z0nhkT7Zb110VbnGjDoY-2_GjfhX5xMo/view?usp=sharing)
